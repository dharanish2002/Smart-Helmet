Abstract: 
Mining operations are inherently hazardous environments for human workers due to the potential risk of catastrophic events such as landslides and toxic gas leaks. This project aims to design a Smart Helmet to ensure the safety of miners. The proposed smart helmet alerts the worker upon detecting a landslide or leakage of colourless and odourless toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, methane, etc. The obtained distress sensor data are pushed to the cloud server with encryption to help future analysis while ensuring data security. This project also involves the development of a webpage that helps to monitor the sensor data from a remote environment. The helmet's built-in GPS aids to constantly track the worker's whereabouts in the mine, allowing for quick response during emergencies.
